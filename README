NAME
    Chart::OFC2 - Generate html and data files for use with Open Flash Chart
    version 2

DESCRIPTION
    OFC2 is a flash script for creating graphs. To have a graph we need an
    open-flash-chart.swf and a JSON data file describing graph data.
    Complete examples you can find after successful run of this module tests
    in t/output/ folder - t/output/bar.html, t/output/pie.html,
    t/output/hbar.html are html graphs and t/output/bad-data.json,
    t/output/pie-data.json, t/output/hbar-data.json are the data files.

AUTHOR

    that is shipped together with all the rest OFC2 files.
